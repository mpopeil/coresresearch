## Purpose

A primary goal of CORES (**CO**lorado **R**eacting flows, **E**lectrochemistry and **S**urface science) Research Group is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of personal background or characteristics (such as, but not limited to:  age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation).  

Discrimination on the basis of age, ancestry, creed, marital status, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, veteran status, or military service is unlawful and therefore prohibited.  This prohibition applies to all students, faculty, staff, contractors, administrators, trustees, visitors, and volunteers.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in CORES Research Group to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open Culture Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open scientific culture citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.


## Scope

We expect all research group participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.  It applies to the behavior of all group participants, ranging from undergraduate researchers to graduate researchers, and to the group PI (Steven DeCaluwe).

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Standards
### a. Relationship to Colorado School of Mines Policies

CORES Research group operates within the confines of the Colorado School of Mines (Mines), and is bound by all state and federal laws which apply thereunto.  For any instance in which the policies outlined herein conflict with Mines policies and regulations, Mines policies will supersede those listed here.  These include, in particular, Mines's [Title IX](https://www.mines.edu/title-ix/) and [Title VII](https://www.mines.edu/equal-opportunity/) policies.

### b. Mandatory reporting

Under Colorado State and US Federal laws, Dr. DeCaluwe is a mandatory reporter.  This means that he is legally required to report any suspected sexual misconduct, including assault/violence, abuse harassment, and/or discrimination, the appropriate authorities in the Title IX office at Mines.  

While he will make any and all efforts to maintain anonymity (i.e. your identity will protected, if at all possible), he cannot therefore promise that any reports will be maintained as confidential.  As described below in the [reporting options](#reporting-guidelines-and-options), anonymous reporting options are available to those for whom anonymity is a significant priority.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.


## Weapons Policy

No weapons will be allowed at CORES Research Group events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.


## Reporting Guidelines and Options

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify Dr. DeCaluwe or other responsible parties as soon as possible.

### a. Report Violations Directly to the PI

#### i. Open reporting
You can report directly to Dr. DeCaluwe, either via email (decaluwe@mines.edu) or by visiting his office (Brown Building W410 B).

#### ii. Via Google form (anonymous option)
You can also report a violation by submitting a complaint via [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8ATTkx-tYL4IDD9ij7GMTX5P3UvaXZeD34gPcfg2L22AEHw/viewform?usp=pp_url).

This form gives you the option of either including your contact information or reporting anonymously.

### b. Other Reporting Options
Additionally, community organizers and Mines personnel are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

These include:

- Confidential reporting through [SpeakUp@Mines](https://www.mines.edu/speak-up/) or the [Mines Title IX office](https://www.mines.edu/title-ix/reporting/)
- Mines [CARE team](https://www.mines.edu/student-life/care/)


## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior and Enforcement

### Consequences
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the research group without warning.  For graduate and undergraduate research assistants, expulsion from the group will also include cancellation of any existing contracts supporting your participation in the group.  In such a case, any existing support for Mines tuition and fees will be revoked, beginning at the end of the current semester.

### Enforcement Procedures and Timeline

- For violations which fall under the purview of Title IX and/or Title VII, issues will be escalated to appropriate Mines personnel.
- For group-specific issues, reasonable steps will be taken to correct the issue, including:

    * Discussion with accused party
    * Change in group structure regarding accused party’s responsibilities and/or office location.  
    * Revocation of right to travel for conferences if relevant/appropriate
    * Dismissal from group and cancellation of contracts

- Depending on the severity of the CoC violation, any or all steps above can be taken, as deemed appropriate.
- Special care will be taken to minimize/avoid any and all negative consequences for the complainant.  Retribution by or on behalf of the accused will not be tolerated and will be cause for immediate dismissal from CORES Research Group.
- For matters completely under PI’s purview, the PI will take initial action within two (2) weeks of receiving a complaint
- The complainant will be kept apprised of the response, as appropriate, and feedback will be solicited upon conclusion of issue to guarantee safety and/or satisfactory resolution for the complainant and to assure that that the [purpose](#purpose) of this Code of Conduct is fulfilled.
